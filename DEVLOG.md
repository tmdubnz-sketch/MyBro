# amo - Development Log

## Overview
**amo** is a privacy-first, multiplatform AI assistant capable of running entirely offline via WebGPU, while also offering ultra-low latency cloud voice interactions via the Gemini 2.5 Live API.

### [v0.1.0] - Foundation & Local Inference
- **Initial Setup**: Scaffolded project using React 19, Vite 6, and Tailwind CSS v4.
- **WebGPU Integration**: Integrated `@mlc-ai/web-llm` to run Large Language Models directly in the browser.
- **Model Support**: Added support for Google's Gemma 2 (2B) and Alibaba's Qwen 2.5 (0.5B, 1.5B).
- **UI Design**: Implemented a "mission control" aesthetic with a dark theme, emerald accents, and a responsive sidebar.

### [v0.2.0] - Chat-First UI & Voice Mode
- **UI Overhaul**: Reorganized the layout to make the chat interface the primary focus. Moved settings and model management into a slide-out modal.
- **Voice Mode**: Implemented native browser Speech Recognition (`webkitSpeechRecognition`) and chunked Speech Synthesis.
- **Zero-Latency Feel**: Engineered a chunked text-to-speech pipeline that speaks sentences as soon as they are generated by the local LLM, rather than waiting for the full response.

### [v0.3.0] - Cloud Voice & Gemini Live
- **Gemini 2.5 Live API**: Integrated `@google/genai` Live API for native voice-to-voice interactions via WebSockets.
- **Audio Processing**: Implemented `AudioContext` and `ScriptProcessorNode` for real-time PCM16 audio streaming (16kHz input, 24kHz output).
- **Dynamic UI**: Added a pulsing microphone interface that activates when the cloud voice model is selected, hiding the standard text chat.

### [v0.4.0] - Multiplatform & PWA (Current)
- **PWA Integration**: Added `vite-plugin-pwa` for native-like installation on iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Added safe-area insets for modern mobile devices (notches, home indicators) and optimized touch targets.
- **Asset Caching**: Configured Workbox to handle large file sizes (up to 10MB) to ensure the WebLLM engine and PWA assets are cached for offline use.
- **Rebranding**: Officially renamed the application to **amo**. Updated system prompts so the AI recognizes its new identity.
