# My Bro - Development Log

## Overview
**My Bro** is a local-first, multiplatform AI assistant designed to run on-device via WebGPU, with optional voice.

---

### [v0.1.0] - Foundation & Local Inference
- **Initial Setup**: Scaffolded project using React 19, Vite 6, and Tailwind CSS v4.
- **WebGPU Integration**: Integrated `@mlc-ai/web-llm` to run Large Language Models directly in the browser.
- **Model Support**: Added support for local WebLLM text models (prebuilt list).
- **UI Design**: Implemented a "mission control" aesthetic with a dark theme, emerald accents, and a responsive sidebar.

### [v0.2.0] - Chat-First UI & Voice Mode
- **UI Overhaul**: Reorganized the layout to make the chat interface the primary focus. Moved settings and model management into a slide-out modal.
- **Voice Mode**: Implemented native browser Speech Recognition (`webkitSpeechRecognition`) and chunked Speech Synthesis.
- **Zero-Latency Feel**: Engineered a chunked text-to-speech pipeline that speaks sentences as soon as they are generated by the local LLM, rather than waiting for the full response.

### [v0.3.0] - Voice Iterations
- **On-device Voice**: Iterated on TTS (system voices + Kokoro) and STT (Whisper) to improve reliability across browsers and Tauri.

### [v0.4.0] - Multiplatform & Desktop (Current)
- **PWA Integration**: Added `vite-plugin-pwa` for native-like installation on iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Added safe-area insets for modern mobile devices (notches, home indicators) and optimized touch targets.
- **Asset Caching**: Configured Workbox to handle large file sizes to ensure engine assets are cached for offline use.
- **Local RAG**: Implemented OPFS-backed SQLite vector database using `@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm` for persistent document storage and semantic search.
- **Vision Capabilities**: Local vision model integration planned (TBD).
- **Thread Management**: Added sidebar history with localStorage persistence for chat sessions.
- **Tauri Desktop App**: Wrapped the PWA using Tauri v2 for native desktop deployment.
- **Desktop Build Outputs**:
  - MSI installer (`My Bro_0.4.0_x64_en-US.msi`)
  - NSIS installer (`My Bro_0.4.0_x64-setup.exe`)
  - Standalone executable (`my-bro.exe`)
- **Plugins**: Configured global-shortcut, notification, shell, and logging plugins for Tauri.
